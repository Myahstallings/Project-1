**About**

Korean egg roll is called gyeran mari / gyeranmari (계란말이). Gyeran (계란) means egg and mari (말이) describes being rolled up. 
Korean egg roll is cooked much like Japanese egg roll – tamagoyaki, but tamagoyaki is a bit sweeter than gyeran mari.

**Calories:** 105kcal



**Ingredients**
> 5 large eggs

> 1 Tbsp rice wine / apple jucie

> 1/4 tsp fine sea salt

> 1 Tbsp green onion , chopped

> 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

> Some cooking oil

**Directons**
1. Break the eggs in a medium sized bowl and beat the eggs lightly. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. Add the rice wine and salt then whisk them well.
Add the chopped green onion.

2. Heat the pan on medium low heat and add some cooking oil. Spread oil throughout the pan and reduce the heat to low. Pour a thin layer of egg mixture onto the pan and spread it by tilting the pan. Once the edge of the egg is cooked and the top of the egg is about 80 to 85% cooked, add a layer of cheese in the middle of the pan and start rolling the egg with a spatula and/or chopsticks.

3. Push aside the rolled egg and brush some cooking oil in the empty space. Pour out another thin layer of egg mixture on the empty space and when the top of the egg is about 80 to 85 % cooked, add a layer of cheese on top of the egg and start rolling the egg with a spatula and/or chopsticks. Repeat this step until the egg mixture is used up.

4. Remove the rolled egg from the pan and cool it down for 5 to 10 mins on a cutting board. Slice it into bite size pieces. Serve.
